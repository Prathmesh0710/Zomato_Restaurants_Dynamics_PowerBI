# Zomato_Restaurants_Dynamics_PowerBI

I built this dashboard to analyze restaurant data, providing valuable insights into restaurant distribution, customer preferences, and operational trends. Here’s what it covers:

✅ Geographical Insights – Interactive Country Map to visualize restaurant presence by city and country.
✅ Time-Based Trends – Calendar table with Year, Month, Quarter, and Financial Year Segmentation for trend analysis.
✅ Restaurant Growth Analysis – Tracking new openings by Year, Quarter, and Month to identify market expansion trends.
✅ Customer Preferences – Insights on restaurant ratings, online delivery, and table booking trends to understand demand.
✅ Pricing & Affordability – Created price buckets to categorize restaurants based on affordability.
✅ Data Visualization – Dynamic charts on cuisines, city-wise distribution, and rating trends for quick insights.

🔍 This dashboard helps businesses and restaurant owners make data-driven decisions, optimize customer experiences, and identify growth opportunities.
